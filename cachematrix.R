## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
## following two functions cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() inv
        list(set=set, get=get, setinverse=setinverse, getinverse=getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix 
## above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## The function below assumes that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
